Hello, This is David Song. 

This repository will be used for your coding practices. We will mainly focus on the front-end of the web-development in a team operation, meaning, learning how to use git will also be crucial.
For farther studies and references, go through [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com).


## Front-end
  Front-end is considered as the face of the web services. It is usually focused on the UI/UX to ensure fluid and consistant design language throughout the whole user experience and to have intuitive placement of the objects within the website. In contrast, back-end is the brain of the web services. They will do the neccessary computing. Lastly, what connects the front-end and the back-end is the APIs(Application programming interface). They can also talk to other websites to retrieve data(e.g. weather information). For me, the front-end has been the hardest as coming up with distinct design took time, whereas building functionality only required for me to make it work. 


** For front-end, HTML, CSS, and JS(Javascript) is used. **
## Html
HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
-> the scaffold of the website

## CSS
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML.
-> make up for the website

## JS
JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.
-> muscle of the website
