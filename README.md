# Passmash Technical Training

Hello, This is David Song. 

This repository will be used for your coding practices. We will mainly focus on the front-end of the web-development in a team operation, meaning, learning how to use git will also be crucial.
For farther studies and references, go through [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com).

As our goal is to build and grow as fast we can, I will expect us to go through this training ASAP.

## Why learn this?
These concepts that we will go through is the fundemental of the web programming. For your future projects and hackathons, even just knowing what this is will help you a lot. Also, this will be more fun than leraning Java or python for the first time as Web-programming is way more visual and it's easier to deploy to the world.

## Why github?
Github is a website that developers use to share their code. It's like instagram for code. As you can see from the name of the website GIT-Hub, they are the hub of "git". Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers who are collaboratively developing source code during software development. Git's goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. So, in college, people use it to save their code, work asynchronously with teammates for hackathon, use this as their portfolio to show how well-written their code is, etc. We will mainly use it to share code with each other.

## Front-end
  Front-end is considered as the face of the web services. It is usually focused on the UI/UX to ensure fluid and consistant design language throughout the whole user experience and to have intuitive placement of the objects within the website. In contrast, back-end is the brain of the web services. They will do the neccessary computing. Lastly, what connects the front-end and the back-end is the APIs(Application programming interface). They can also talk to other websites to retrieve data(e.g. weather information). For me, the front-end has been the hardest as coming up with distinct design took time, whereas building functionality only required for me to make it work. 


**For front-end, HTML, CSS, and JS(Javascript) is used.**
### Html
HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
-> the scaffold of the website

### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML.
-> make up for the website

### JS
JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.
-> muscle of the website


## Framework
Framework is something developers made that improves the web experience by putting steroids in HTML, CSS, and JS. There are so many frameworks for every aspects of the web development. What you must learn throughout this course would be learning React. 

### React.js
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.

The benefit of using this framework is that so many developers including big companies use this framework for their web and app developemnt(as Meta/Facebook made it).

That's why I will require you to skeem through HTML, CSS, JS as fast as you can so we can dive in to react development.
